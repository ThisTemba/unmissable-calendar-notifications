# Unmissable Calendar Notifications

Google Calendar notifications on your desktop so big that you can't miss them.

## Notes

- later on can read notification preferences from google calendar, optionally

## Logging & Down Detection

Unmissable notifications should be running all the time. So:

1. If something goes wrong, you won't be watching and you need logs to tell you how to fix it. Check the logs.
2. If for any reason the program stops running, you need to be notified as soon as possible. I have used healthchecks.io for this purpose.

## Next Steps

If you don't see the notification until after it has started, may want to show the alert a few minutes longer.
